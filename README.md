# Soda Verifier
Soda purchase authentication for small restauraunts. 

# How It Works (for users)
When your employee sells a soda they press the print button on the kiosk, which then prints out a new barcode sticker. The customer will then scan that barcode which will turn on the soda machine. After one hour, the barcode will cease to turn on the machine.
